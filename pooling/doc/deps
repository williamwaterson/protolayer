Package Dependencies

The packages within the source code hierarchy of  
related to each other in a directed-acyclic graph of
dependencies. As such, the related ant build.xml has
been structured so that instead of compiling the entire
source in one go, individual packages are sequentially
built according to thsis dependency hierarchy. In this
way, any cyclic dependencies introduced by developers
will be caught at compile time.
