propagate scopes into typedefs

Recode everything to use vector assembly of stanzas for each type and then using pointers into that ordered collection 

Check to see if namespace is working correctly

1. Provide means to provide inclass method definition (by skipping contents of defintiion between { and }

2. provide means to handle template function and template class

1. Provide means to handle inline keyword

1. Ensure better detection of which class should be scanned for annotatinos in relation to method definitions in the source file read (better idenditicaiton of the class decleartion to be scanned)

1. Add stateless / stateful as parameters to @remote (make default based on other 

3. Fix cases where no attributes or methods available so as to drop any visibility scopes from output

4. Add session id to stateful case and mapping to instances

5. Add options on annotations

6. Add xdr/xml options on serialise 

7. Add xdr/soap option on remote

8. Add collection detection and template detection in class

9. Ensure prototype always generates public attributes or public setters/getters

10. Add setter getter options on prototype
